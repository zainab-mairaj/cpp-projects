Project Title: Guess The Number Game (C++)

Description:
This program generates a random number between 1 and 100. The user keeps guessing numbers until they find the correct secret number. After each guess, the program gives a hint whether the guess is too low or too high.

Concepts Learned:
Random number generation using rand() and srand()
Seeding randomness using time(0)
Using loops (while(true))
Conditional decisions (if/else)

Example Output:

Guess the number (between 1 and 100):
30
Too low! Try again:
78
Too high! Try again:
55
Too low! Try again:
60
Correct! You guessed the number!


Future Improvements:
Count number of attempts
Limit maximum attempts (e.g. 7 tries like actual guess games)
Add difficulty levels (Easy/Medium/Hard)
Store user high score
