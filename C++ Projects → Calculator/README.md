Description:
This program allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division) between two numbers using if / else statements.

Concepts learned:
Taking input from user in C++
Using if/else statements
Using arithmetic operators
Handling division by zero

Sample Input / Output:

Enter first number: 7  
Enter operator (+ - * /): *  
Enter second number: 5  
Result = 35


Future Improvements:
Convert code to switch statement
Add loop to allow multiple calculations
Add functions for each operation
